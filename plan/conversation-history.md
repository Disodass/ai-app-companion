# Reconstruct Conversation History

1. Use the provided Node helper to dump every conversation/message tied to user `E7USlxuqx1dZdJOpd9uT5ufnQsy1`.
2. Organize the output by conversation ID and summarize message counts/timestamps so the user sees where history resides.
3. Present the findings (and note next steps if consolidation is desired).
